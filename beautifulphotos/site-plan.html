      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Hi, I’m Jarom Costales, I am a programmer and I also love photography. I have worked on several projects of compiling and editing photos and videos before. I want to create a website where people can store and find photos and videos that they can use everywhere and are free for commercial use. They can use it on their website, blog, product or anywhere else. It will be a library that is donated by a global community of photographers who are willing to share their work for everyone to use freely. </p>  <!-- change this -->
      <p>Do you like browsing the web to find cool photos and videos that you can use everywhere? If so, then this is a website you should definitely bookmark. It hosts collections of photos and videos of nature, portrait, abstract, landscape, sports and many other things. These photos and videos are shared by amazing photographers from all around the world. Plus, it’s a great place to get inspiration for ideas as well, whether you’re thinking about becoming a photographer too. </p>

      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>People from all over the world</p>  <!-- change this -->

        Color Palette

      <!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

      <!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below Make sure to paste it into both spots -->
      Palette URL: <a href="https://coolors.co/396e94-e7c24f-a43312-381d2a-aabd8c" target="_blank">https://coolors.co/396e94-e7c24f-a43312-381d2a-aabd8c</a>

      <h2>
        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        This will be a website where people can store and find photos and videos that they can use everywhere and are free for commercial use. They can use it on their website, blog, product or anywhere else. It will be a library that is donated by a global community of photographers who are willing to share their work for everyone to use freely. It will kind of be like google photos with a mix of canvas. It will be a storage place for photos and videos, and if they are willing, they can allow other people to see their storage. The homepage will look something like this: 
      </p>
        <img src="pexels1.jpg" alt="">
        <img src="pexels2.jpg" alt="">

      </ul>
      <h3>[Page 2]</h3>
      <p>
        People will come to my website because we now live in a world where taking photos is very accessible. In fact, I believe most people like taking photos everywhere they go or in whatever they do and with that, they need a place where they can store those photos and videos. And my website will be a huge help for them. Also, it will not just be for people who wants to store photos but also for those people who want to take pictures online for their website, school project, wallpaper, product or any other. 
      </p>
      <p> Page 2 will look something like this </p>
        <img src="pexels3" alt="">
        <img src="pexels4.jpg" alt="">
        <img src="pexels5.jpg" alt="">

      </ul>
      <h3>[Page 3]</h3>
      <p>
        For page 3, when the user select a picture, it will have individual photo and will also give the user some features to save, edit or share. 
      </p>
      <p> Page 3 will look something like this </p>
        <img src="pexels6.jpg" alt="">
        <img src="#" alt="">

      </ul>
      <hr>
      <h2>
        Wireframes

        Create three wireframes for your site. One for each page and list them here</p>
